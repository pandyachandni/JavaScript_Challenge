# JavaScript_Challenge

#Overview of Project: 
The purpose of this project was to learn how to take data that was stored in a Javascript array/list and then create a table to organize the information that will visually show "event" changes or known as filters. When elements are changed, Javascript functions will help loop data to create a table. The filters help create an interactive webpage. 

#Results:

By placing in selected conditions you are able to filter selected data.

#Summary:
Con: The search field is "case-sensitive" so the table will not let you make changes if it is not entered how exactly it was stored. For the user it can be difficult because how is that known.

Pro:
With adding all the filters it can improve the user's experience.
